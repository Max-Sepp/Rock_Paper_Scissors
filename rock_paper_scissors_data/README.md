# The Dataset

Feel free to make contributions to the dataset but please maintain the 2:1 ratio of train images to test images. 
Ideally the background and the colour of the hand would have a strong contrast. 
You can either change the background or as I have done wear a glove.

### Info about the dataset

For each category there is 200 train photos and 100 test photos.
Half of the photos are of the right hand and half are of the left hand so there is no bias within in the dataset.
