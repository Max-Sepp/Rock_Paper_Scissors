I have built an AI that can determine whether your hand position is either rock, paper or scissors from a photo from a bird's eye view. I did the whole project from start to finish: building the dataset, producing the model and then producing a mini game to have a fun interaction with the model.

# The Goal

To build a AI that you could recognise the hand gestures of rock paper scissors. 

### For information on the dataset read the README within the dataset folder: rock_paper_scissors_data
